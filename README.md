# sunnyApp
Tool to handle pokemon fights on Sunrise. Input pokemon stats and attacks, output the full fight in a "ready to post on Sunrise" format. 

Python source code, database file (.sqlite) and graphic interface file (.ui)

You can replace the .py file by an executable to avoid having to install python and the libraries

Just need to place the sqlite, ui, and either the .py or .exe file in the same directory and execute it !
